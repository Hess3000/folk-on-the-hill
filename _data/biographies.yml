      Holy Moly & The Crackers make riotous party music for the masses. Their
      upcoming third album, ‘Take A Bite’ (released April 5th 2019 on the band’s
      own Pink Lane Records), is concise, passionate take on folk, blues and
      indie rock. The sound of a band who have been searching and experimenting
      for several years; arriving at a place where they can say “this who we are
      and this is where we want to go”.
