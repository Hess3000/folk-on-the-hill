artist_1: Holy Molly & The Crackers
artist_1_description: Holy Moly & The Crackers make riotous party music for the masses. Their upcoming third album, ‘Take A Bite’ (released April 5th 2019 on the band’s own Pink Lane Records), is concise, passionate take on folk, blues and indie rock. The sound of a band who have been searching and experimenting for several years; arriving at a place where they can say “this who we are and this is where we want to go”.
