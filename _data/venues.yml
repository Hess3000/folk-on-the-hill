venue_1_description: The Ryan theatre is a modern, well appointed and comfortable theatre which although it has seating for over 300+ guests has a very intimate feel.  This venue is Folk-On-The-Hill's main stage and all featured artists will be performing here along with (time permitting) a stage for introducing less experienced acts who deserve and would benefit from playing to a large audience.  Food and drink will be available outside the auditorium with a pleasant garden area as it's dining area.
